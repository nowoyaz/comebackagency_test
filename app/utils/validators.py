Question: What is optical fiber/how does it work? Answer:

Optical fiber is an advanced technology for drones that ensures data transmission through an optical cable at a speed of 1,000 Mbps, which is 100 times faster than radio communication. Using spools of optical fiber allows the drone to stay reliably connected even at distances of up to 10 kilometers. The cable does not interfere with flight and enables the drone to operate efficiently in environments with intense electronic warfare. Optical fiber enhances the efficiency and safety of drones by providing resistance to radio interference and reliable data transmission, even when flying through trees or other obstacles."""
